## Featured Projects

- [Online Fraud Detection](https://github.com/paulocpaixao/fraud_detection/blob/main/fraud_detection.ipynb): The project involved the development of a machine learning system for fraud detection in payment transactions. Relevant data such as transaction amounts, timestamps, and transaction types, along with customer transaction history, were collected and analyzed. 
- [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/paulocpaixao/breast_cancer/blob/main/load_breast_cancer.ipynb): The project focused on utilizing machine learning techniques for cancer prediction. It involved the analysis of various medical data, such as patient demographics, medical history, and diagnostic test results. By applying advanced algorithms, a predictive model was developed to assess the likelihood of an individual having cancer.
- [Kmeans](https://github.com/paulocpaixao/kmeans_elbow_and_silhouette/blob/main/Kmeans_Clustering_Using_Elbow_and_Silhouette.ipynb): In this project, we explore and compare the widely used techniques of K-means Elbow and Silhouette in cluster analysis for clustering algorithms like K-means. These approaches play a crucial role in determining the optimal number of clusters and evaluating the quality of obtained clusters. By investigating and analyzing the application of these methods in our study, we aim to gain a deeper understanding of the structures and patterns present in our data, providing a solid foundation for informed decision-making.
- [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/paulocpaixao/house_price_prediction/blob/main/House_Price_Prediction.ipynb): This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict house prices. Accurate and reliable price prediction is of great importance to buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. By applying advanced machine learning techniques, our goal is to create a model that considers a variety of house characteristics and attributes to provide precise and valuable estimates.
- [Dashboard of House Sales](https://github.com/paulocpaixao/dashboard_house_sales/blob/main/README.md): The real estate sales dashboard provides a detailed view of real estate sales activities over a specific period. Key indicators include the total sales value, the average price of houses sold, and the distribution of sales by property type. This dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of the real estate market, helping professionals in the industry make informed decisions and identify growth opportunities.
